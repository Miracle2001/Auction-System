                   <p> Eauction is a secure online auction managment system for the University of Limerick students.
                        Most students are frustrated because they don't know 
                        what to do with their extra belongings once they've packed, and because the university 
                        doesn't have a storage facility for students, they either leave them at the accommodation 

                        reception or rely on social media group chats or third-party apps like Depop or Facebook to 

                        sell them, so this auction system is a way for students to earn extra money.  </p>

                    <p> Eauction provides a means for the students to to sell 
                        their items to their target markets, while buyers will be able to purchase used items at a 
                       lower price, resulting in a win-win situation for all.
